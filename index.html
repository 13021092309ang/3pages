        <p><em>Dota 2</em></p>
<p>Having lost some of her "competitive drive" for StarCraft II, Hostyn switched to playing Dota 2 in February 2015, explaining "If I can be good at both it’ll be something nobody has really done before."</p>

<p><em>Return to StarCraft II</em></p>

        id="section5"><em><strong>Play Style</strong></em>
        <p>Scarlett favors using Zerglings, Banelings and Mutalisks, though she has also displayed proficiency with Infestors, Brood Lords and Ultralisks. She also was one of the first,  to use Infested Terrans to bait Widow Mine hits (against Mvp in her GSTL debut). Her play style's defining feature, though, is her Creep spread, which has been spotlighted and can stretch to opposing bases by the time of a decisive engagement.</p>
